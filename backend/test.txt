Over 122.6 million people are forcibly displaced globally
At the end of June 2024, 122.6 million people worldwide remained forcibly displaced due to persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations or events seriously disturbing public order.

This represents an increase of 5 per cent, or 5.3 million people, compared to the end of 2023.

For more than 12 years the number of people remaining forcibly displaced has continued to grow. By the end of June 2024, 1 in 67 people worldwide remained forcibly displaced, almost double the 1 in 114 people a decade ago. Most forcibly displaced people, 87 per cent, live in low- and middle-income countries.

UNHCR estimates that forced displacement has increased further since June 2024, and barring rapid positive developments in one or more large displacement situations, will continue to rise in 2024.
